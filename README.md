# Atomic Scala

+ Solutions for Atomic Scala Book by Bruce Eckel and Dianne Marsh for First time functional programmers in scala.  
+ Directories for each and every chapter are created, check in `src/main/scala`  
+ Download the pdf [here](https://github.com/absognety/atomic-scala/blob/master/Atomic%20Scala.pdf)  
+ The online support/stackoverflow threads for learning and debugging scala programs is limited, so I wanted to have my own stackoverflow thread to turn to for writing scala programs with less development time and more efficiently, which motivated me to read the whole book and solve exercises at the end of every chapter and present the solutions here.  
+ **Disclaimer: This repository is not a duplicate of any existing solution you find.**  

# How to run scala program from command-line/Terminal:  
  
+ Go to the location where your scala code is residing.  
+ Compile it using `scalac` for example `scalac -classpath /path/to/your/classes HelloWorld.scala`  
+ A Directory with same name as package is created in the same location by default if the classpath argument is not provided.  
+ Run your program using `scala /path/to/your/classes/packagename.HelloWorld`
